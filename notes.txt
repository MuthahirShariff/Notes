GIT HUB

1.Ajile methodology:-


2.GitHub Repository: 
     GitHub repository is defined as a location in the GitHub platform where the files and codes corresponding to the projects and their respective versions as a part of revision history is stored, managed, and used. One can discuss and manage the entire projectâ€™s work inside the repository itself.

3.Remote Repository:
    Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.

     there are two ways to push or pull remote url. they are,
     a.HTTPS URL
     b.SSH URL

4.Local Repository: 
     A local repository is a local directory structure that caches artifacts downloaded from remote repositories, or those that are manually installed (eg from the command line option). A remote repository is a web service (defined by a URL) that contains versioned artifacts.

5.Version Control:
     Version control systems are software that help track changes make in code over time. As a developer edits code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files. It then saves that snapshot permanently so it can be recalled later if needed.

6.Beifits of VersionControl:
     Without version control, developers are tempted to keep multiple copies of code on their computer. This is dangerous because it's easy to change or delete a file in the wrong copy of code, potentially losing work. Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of the code, but presenting the team with a single version at a time.

7.GitHub:
   GitHub is a social network for programmers. Git is a distributed software management program created by Linus Torvalds, originally for the Linux Kernel Development. GitHub is a hosted Git repository. Github allows you to take part in collaboration by forking projects, sending and pulling requests, and monitoring development.
